This program shows you how to obtain lua functions and data from lua
scripts when embedding lua scripting enging into a C program.

==REQUIREMENT==

This program requires lua-5.2 to run. If package manager of your
system did not have it, you should compile your copy or obtain a
binary package.

Precompiled binary packages of lua can be obtained from:

http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaBinaries

To compile your lua-5.2 copy, please download your copy of lua-5.2
from:

http://www.lua.org/download.html

and compile it with Makefile contained in the source tarball.

==USAGE==

To use it, first compile it by using the Makefile, then call the
program by:

./build/out

which is default output of the Makefile script. (If you don't like
this name, just change it!)

The program will enter interactive mode after you run it. First it
asks for an action, which is a lua script. You should enter a path to
a lua script to satisfy its request.

The program then loads the lua script, and runs the script to obtain
parameter count (paramCount) and a calculation function (calc).

The program will obtain integer parameters from the users according to
paramCount. After the program get every parameters, those parameters
will be used as calc function input, and calc function will be run.

After calculation is done, the result will be returned and printed to
the screen.

==CUSTOM SCRIPT==

As described above, this program accepts any lua scripts with 2
globals: paramCount and calc. 'calc' should be a function doing
calculation, and paramCount should indicate parameter count of calc
function. Inconsistency will cause error.

To see examples, just look for *.lua scripts in the root directory of
the source package.
